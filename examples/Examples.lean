# Minimal downstream consumer

This module is not part of the `Erdos249257` library. It imports the package
root exactly as an external project would (`import Erdos249257`) and derives a
small corollary through the advertised public interface, so the release is
demonstrably usable from outside, not merely internally buildable. CI builds
it with `lake build Examples`.

The same proof-trust rules apply here as in the library: no `sorry`, no
`admit`, no new axioms (`scripts/check_release.py` scans this directory too).

is supplied by the library, while the analytic shell estimate remains an
explicit hypothesis. In particular, this does not prove the universal
Erdős #257 statement for arbitrary infinite supports. -/
