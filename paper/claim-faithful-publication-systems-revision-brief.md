# Revision brief: Lean publication-systems paper

The current seven-page paper is an architecture note with one bounded case
study. Its useful feature is its order: it gives the reader a plain mental
model before implementation details. Future revisions should keep that order
while testing whether the paper actually earns every page.

## Reader and decision

Write for a technically competent outsider who has never used Lean, has not
read this repository, and does not know its history. By the end, that reader
should be able to explain:

1. what Lean checks;
2. what a mathematician still has to judge;
3. how a reviewed public claim is connected to formal source;
4. what the release checks repeat;
5. what a passing release does not establish; and
6. where to inspect one complete example.

The paper's purpose is trust calibration, not exhaustive documentation.
Use ordinary mathematical and software language for that calibration. Give a
reader the public meaning before a claim identifier, declaration name, file
path, or repository-specific status label, and omit internal workflow
vocabulary that the argument does not need.

## Distinct job from `ARCHITECTURE.md`

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` is the living route map: current files, commands,
  ownership, regeneration, and maintenance.
- The PDF is the stable explanation: why authority is divided, how one claim
  crosses the boundary, and where the guarantee ends.

They should agree without becoming two independently exhaustive manuals.

## Cold-reader loop

Use simulated and human readers to find high-level failures, then revise by
the governing purpose rather than mechanically accepting sentence edits.
For each reading, record:

- the first point where the reader can explain the system back;
- the first claim they do not believe and why;
- any concept introduced before its purpose is clear;
- what they think the paper is trying to contribute;
- what they believe the checks prove;
- what they still cannot locate after reading; and
- what they would remove first.

The paper remains under a ten-page ceiling. Prefer removing duplication,
making one worked example more concrete, and clarifying authority over adding
terminology, counts, scripts, or new claims of importance. A revision is not
ready merely because the TeX compiles: render every page, inspect the diagram
and tables at reading size, and leave no clipping, overlap, or layout warning.
