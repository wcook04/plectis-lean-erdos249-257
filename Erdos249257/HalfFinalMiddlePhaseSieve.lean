# A finite phase sieve for the final `-2` middle cell

The existing lazy-tail argument forces a hypothetical final middle cell of
charge `-2` into the phase `D = 2 (mod 3)`.  The exact middle landing then
starts the all-right signed excess at `2`.  Forced ranks `2`, `3`, `6`, `7`,
and `14` leave only five joint `21`-phases.  The exact prefix through rank
`20` and `21` sharpen that sieve to thirty-five classes modulo `210`.  The
next forced rank is `26`; its pulse removes a full phase modulo `13` and one
additional joint phase, leaving 412 classes modulo `2730`.

its cofinite half on even rows, and the forced seam ranks `2,3,6`.  This is

/-! ## A longer forced seam prefix -/

/-- From row twenty onward, the remainder after the forced ranks
`2,3,6,7` skips every rank from `8` through `13` and then takes rank `14`.
The two common-denominator estimates are exact: adding rank `13` pushes the
reciprocal sum above one half, whereas adding rank `14` leaves deficit
`1 / 688086`; the dyadic side term fits inside that deficit once `s ≥ 20`. -/
