# Wave 22: carry-survivor extinction and the multiple-period collapse

Wave 21 reduced #249 to a certified kill supply: for every period `h ≥ 1` and
every threshold `N₀`, some `(N ≥ N₀, L)` with the endpoint residue certificate
`certifiedKill h N L`.  This file spends two further consequences of
rationality that the wave-21 socket left on the table.

**1. The multiple-period collapse.**  If `h₀` is an eventual binary period,
every multiple `m·h₀` is too, by pure telescoping:

  `D_{m·h}(N) = ∑_{i<m} D_h(N + i·h)`,   `D_h(N) = R_{N+h} - R_N`.

So the supply obligation weakens from *kill every `h`* to *kill one multiple
per divisibility ray* (`irrational_totient_series_of_multiple_survivor_supply`)
— and further collapses onto the ONE-PARAMETER family `lcm(1..t)`, since every
`h₀ ≤ t` divides `lcm(1..t)`
(`irrational_totient_series_of_lcm_survivor_supply`).  The throat of #249
narrows from a ∀h family of targets to a single ℕ-indexed ray.

**2. The carry-survivor certificate.**  The wave-21 note called the
bounded-orbit reformulation advisory.  Here it is machine-checked: doubling
the tail shifts the window by one and expels the head totient
(`totientTail_succ`), so an integer tail difference `d = D_h(N)` launches the
exact integer orbit

  `orbit 0 = d`,  `orbit (i+1) = 2·orbit i - (φ(N+i+1+h) - φ(N+i+1))`,

which tracks `D_h(N+i)` forever (`carryOrbit_eq_tail_diff`) and is therefore
trapped in the strip `|·| < N+i+h+2` (`abs_tail_diff_lt`).  The certificate
`survivorKill h N K` checks — finitely, decidably — that every integer
candidate in the initial box escapes the strip within `K` steps; soundness is
`tail_diff_notMem_int_of_survivorKill`.  The survivor predicate is strictly
stronger than the endpoint certificate at equal depth
(`survivor_strict_at_equal_budget`, a `decide` witness at `(1, 57, 8)`), but
the wave-22 probe measures the two families as near-equivalent in minimal
kill depth — the deepest scale dominates.  The probe's honest summary: the
multiple-period loosening is the logical gain; the survivor form is the
bounded-orbit lane made kernel-checkable.

**Deposits.**  `certifiedKill_all_upto_sixteen` machine-checks kills for every
`h ≤ 16` at `(N, L) = (14, 9)` — twice the wave-21 period range in a smaller
window — giving the extended exclusion
`totient_series_ne_rat_of_den_dvd_upto_sixteen`: `S` is no rational whose
denominator divides `2¹⁴·(2ʰ-1)` for any `h ≤ 16`.

Everything remains elementary: `φ(n) ≤ n`, geometric tails, integer orbit
arithmetic.  No q-Padé, no Stern–Brocot, no unformalised citations.
