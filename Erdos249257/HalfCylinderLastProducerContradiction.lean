# The last seam producer versus an eventual right tail

If the integer seam were eventually right, the explicit false terminal at
row thirteen would have a last successor row `D` with false terminal.  That
last non-right transition is either an upper producer or a middle producer.

The upper case is impossible unconditionally: its terminal-augmented affine
carry is at most `-8`, while the eventual right tail puts the corresponding
lazy endpoint below `1/2`.

The middle case is reduced to the exact, weak inequality that its positive
affine carry beats the complete future divisor-incidence tail.  A convenient
stronger socket asks only for the already-proved square-root majorant.  This
is substantially weaker than the exponential largest-skip socket.
