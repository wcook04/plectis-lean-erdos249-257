# A cardinality-scale bound for the last middle producer

The square-root envelope for an arbitrary divisor-incidence support is much
larger than necessary for a finite seam prefix.  If `F` is finite, every
future coefficient counts at most `F.card` divisors, and the normalized
binary geometric tail has total mass one.  Hence

`binaryCoeffTail (supportCoeff (↑F)) N ≤ F.card`.

For the concrete middle producer this gives an alternative reduction of the
remaining tail escape to the exact natural-number inequality

`card(below support) + belowPulse + 5 < 4 * remainder`.

Equivalently, the affine carry is larger than the cardinality of the
terminal-augmented support.  This is sharper than the generic square-root
strip only for sparse finite prefixes; it is not a uniform improvement when
the support cardinality grows linearly with the row.  It does handle the
exceptional middle row seven, where the square-root inequality is false.
The theorem below does not assert the remaining cardinality inequality; it
exposes its exact arithmetic content.

/-! ## Reverse classification of a small seam remainder

The exact three-branch recurrence already rules out one apparent source of
a late row-scale failure.  A middle successor contains the full positive
gap `2^(s+1)` and loses only the linear row pulse, so it cannot create a
remainder below the next row.  More strongly, once the source remainder is
at least its row, a middle successor enters the exponential barrier

`2^(s+1) + (s+1) ≤ R_(s+1)`.

That barrier is preserved by every subsequent right successor.  Therefore a
hypothetical first late row with `R_s < s`, traced backwards over its final
run of right successors, cannot have a middle producer at the start of the
run.  Its last producer must be an upper/successor-carry reset.  This is the
formal part of the reverse-classification route; excluding the remaining
upper-reset ancestry is still an arithmetic obligation.

/-! ## Exact upper-reset cylinders

The preceding barrier identifies the only remaining ancestry of a late
row-small remainder: an upper reset followed by right branches.  For that
case it is important not to throw away the reset geometry.  The recursive
charge below records every right-branch pulse with its exact base-four
weight.  Its additive form avoids all truncated subtraction.

/-! ## A two-sided dyadic branch invariant

There is a substantially smaller local obstruction than the full reset-band
socket.  At row `s`, compare both sides of the adjacent cut with `2^s`.
The upper branch always puts the next lower remainder below `2^(s+1)`.
On the middle branch, the lower candidate and its terminal toggle show that
one of the two next distances is below `2^(s+1)`, except when the signed
middle coordinate is one of `-3, -2, -1`.  On the right branch the lower
side of the invariant propagates unconditionally; the upper side propagates
as soon as its pulse-corrected charge does not cross `2^(s+2)`.

The lemmas in this section are unconditional branch algebra.  They isolate
the two actual-run cells which a future induction must exclude; they do not
assert that those cells are absent.

/-! ### Pure-half prefix coordinate

The same two-sided invariant has a useful one-coordinate normal form.  Run
the descending integer greedy algorithm on the old-rank seam weights, but at
the unshifted half capacity `2^(2*s-1)`.  This capacity is exactly `2^s`
above the seam target.  The greedy sum is therefore the seam upper word when
that word lies in the added half-gap, and the seam lower word otherwise.

feed `j` right steps (the exact cylinder forbids them); values below the
window cannot end row-small (the preceding lower bound forbids them).

/-! ## Last-ancestor fan-in

The dyadic band is not merely a local estimate.  It forces the row-scale
middle socket consumed above.  The proof takes the first row whose remainder
is smaller than its index, then the last false terminal before it.  Every
intervening transition is right.  A middle last ancestor enters the preserved
exponential barrier; an upper last ancestor is excluded by the band.
