"""Regenerate every committed projection in dependency order, then verify.

``check_release.py`` regenerates six projections with ``--check`` and fails if
any committed copy is stale. Refreshing them by hand means remembering six
commands in the right order, and forgetting one is not hypothetical: on
2026-07-19 a run of paper edits refreshed the corpus descriptor and the
publication entry packet but never re-ran ``refresh_source_coordinates.py``, so
the paper anchors in ``docs/claims.json`` stayed pinned to pre-edit line numbers
for ten commits and release-surfaces was red the whole way.

Run this after editing claims, the atlas, the methodology, or the paper, and
commit whatever it rewrites together with the edit that caused it. Pushing the
content commit on its own leaves a commit in history that continuous integration
will mark red, because ``docs/corpus_descriptor.json`` records the last commit
that touched its inputs and cannot cite the commit it is being committed in.
