# Prior art and attribution map

This is a reading map for the mathematical sources cited in the exposition. It
records relationship, not proof authority: only the pinned Lean source
establishes what this release proves. A citation never widens a release claim,
and a source listed as *context* is not an imported argument or a claim of
mathematical priority. Formalisation/software dependencies are recorded in
[CITATION.cff](../CITATION.cff); the Erdős Problems catalogue supplies
numbering and status context rather than mathematical priority.

The [exposition](../paper/erdos249-257-main-paper.tex) and the
[transport/curvature companion](../paper/erdos249-transport-curvature-companion-note.tex)
together form the mathematics bibliography. [CITATION.cff](../CITATION.cff) is intentionally
selected release/software citation metadata: it supplies the recommended
citation for this version and selected foundational or software references,
not a duplicate bibliography. This map explains why the principal sources are
credited.

## Bounded comparison route

Start with
`python3 scripts/query_corpus.py --route trace_prior_art`, then select the
exact local claim with `python3 scripts/query_corpus.py --claim <claim_id>`.
Read its registry status, statement, assumptions, remaining-open links, and
Lean declarations before interpreting any row below. A status such as
`proved here` or `formalised here` is an evidence statement, not a novelty
statement.

For a theorem-level comparison, record the source statement, assumptions,
conclusion, specialisation map, proof mechanism, and residual difference
against that selected local claim. Failure to identify a matching source is
not evidence of novelty. Lean source checked by the pinned Lean kernel remains
proof authority; this bibliography and its search history are authored
attribution evidence only.

| Source | Relationship to this release | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| P. Erdős and R. L. Graham, [*Old and New Problems and Results in Combinatorial Number Theory* (1980)](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~ronspubs/80_11_number_theory.pdf); P. Erdős, [*On the irrationality of certain series: problems and results* (1988)](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511897184.009) | Original published formulations for the #249 and #257 problem setting. | They formulate open problems; they are not proofs of either universal statement. |
| S. Chowla, [*On Series of the Lambert Type which assume Irrational Values for Rational Values of the Argument* (1947)](https://insa.nic.in/UI/Archivesection.aspx?JID=MA%3D%3D&JYrs=MTk0Nw%3D%3D) | Historical conjectural predecessor: its rational-argument Lambert question contains the full-support specialisation \(x=1/b\). | Chowla's source is a conjecture in this relation, not the proof source; the theorem formalised here is credited to Erdős (1948). |
| P. Erdős, [*On arithmetical properties of Lambert series* (1948)](https://users.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1948-04.pdf) | Full-support Erdős--Borwein irrationality formalised here. | The formalisation is a checked rendering, not a priority claim. |
| P. Erdős, [*On the irrationality of certain series* (Math. Student 36, 1968)](https://users.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1969-09.pdf) | Pairwise-coprime support condition. | Only that classical family is attributed to this source; it does not settle universal #257. |
| P. B. Borwein, [*On the irrationality of certain series* (1992)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S030500410007081X) | Broader irrationality theorem containing the relevant Mersenne--Lambert specialisation. | Context for the full-support family, not a proof route for the new #249 reductions. |
| The explicit #249 denominator bound and complete tail-certificate normal form in this release | The comparison search covered the original problem sources, Erdős's and Borwein's Lambert-series theorems, periodic-coefficient results, and current arithmetic-function series literature. No theorem with the same quantitative denominator exclusion or the same pointwise certificate equivalence was identified as of 16 July 2026. | This is a dated search result, not a priority or novelty theorem. A closer antecedent should replace the negative search statement if one is found. |
| H. Kaneko, Y. Suzuki, and Y. Tachiya, [*Refinements of Erdős's irrationality criterion for certain sparse infinite series* (2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20743) | Nearby current work proving irrationality for sparse series such as \(\sum d(n)^k/t^{\varphi(n)}\). | Here \(\varphi(n)\) occurs in the exponent. It does not treat the coefficient-weighted constant \(\sum\varphi(n)/2^n\), its denominator bound, or its tail-certificate equivalence. |
| Finite-difference and affine-moment transport used in the companion | General algebraic techniques, applied here to exact Möbius residue kernels and totient-tail windows. The primary-source search found no cited theorem matching the release's combined curvature, prime-jump, anchored `(3,5)`, or fixed-precision no-go statements. | Absence of an identified match is not a novelty claim. The release claims only the pinned Lean theorems and keeps the open supply hypotheses explicit; a closer theorem-level antecedent should be added if identified. |
| T. M. Apostol, [*Introduction to Analytic Number Theory* (1976)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4757-5579-4); M. Merca, [*The Lambert series factorization theorem* (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11139-016-9856-3); M. Merca and M. D. Schmidt, [*Generating Special Arithmetic Functions by Lambert Series Factorizations* (2019)](https://doi.org/10.55016/ojs/cdm.v14i1.62425) | Apostol supplies the classical Dirichlet/Möbius background; Merca gives the modern factorisation theorem and Merca--Schmidt its synthesis/unification treatment. | The release uses classical transforms and claims a Lean-checked composition, not new Möbius inversion, Lambert identities, or the cited factorisation theorems. |
| Y. V. Nesterenko, [*Modular functions and transcendence questions* (1996)](https://doi.org/10.1070/SM1996v187n09ABEH000158) | Direct source for the cited-only transcendence of the divisor-sum ladder rung \(L(\mathrm{Id})=\sum_{m\geq1}\sigma(m)/2^m\). | This positions one ladder row only; no part of its modular-transcendence proof is formalised here. |
| K. Postelmans and W. Van Assche, [*Irrationality of \(\zeta_q(1)\) and \(\zeta_q(2)\)* (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnt.2006.11.011) | Primary source for the cited-only linear independence of \(1,\zeta_q(1),\zeta_q(2)\) when \(q^{-1}\) is an integer of absolute value greater than one. At \(q=1/2\), this implies the irrationality of the squared-ladder value \(L_2(\mathbf1)=\zeta_{1/2}(2)-\zeta_{1/2}(1)\). | The release formalises the identity placing \(L_2(\mathbf1)\) in this q-zeta family, not the Hermite--Padé proof. Linear independence of the constant-weight row gives no irrationality transfer to the Möbius row \(L_2(\mu)=S-1/2\), which remains open. |
| The reduced-direction, Stern--Brocot cylinder, and continuant-run package in this release | Apostol and the Lambert-factorisation sources above supply the classical divisor/Möbius setting; Farey's note supplies the historical mediant language; Postelmans--Van Assche position only the adjacent constant-weight squared-Lambert row. The release proves an exact Mersenne-weight probability normalization, a telescoping cylinder law with uniform geometric error, and sharp Fibonacci/continuant run estimates. | No priority claim is made for this assembled package. The run estimates have no endpoint consumer, and the equality between their Fibonacci height and denominator scales does not prove denominator survival or irrationality of \(S\). |
| S. Kakeya, [*On the Set of Partial Sums of an Infinite Series* (1914)](https://doi.org/10.11429/ptmps1907.7.14_250) | Classical strict-tail criterion for subsum sets: domination of every remaining tail by its term gives the Cantor-set regime. | The release uses this as historical geometry, not as a claim that Kakeya supplied the local executable machinery. |
| V. Kovač and T. Tao, [*On several irrationality problems for Ahmes series* (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10474-025-01528-0) | Direct fixed-base antecedent: their Remark 4.1 verifies \(\sum_{\ell>n}(t^\ell-1)^{-1}<(t^n-1)^{-1}\) for every integer \(t\ge2\), and deduces distinct Lambert subsums and a Cantor set. | At \(t=2\) this supplies the known Mersenne geometry. The release now formalises compactness, perfection, total disconnectedness, nowhere density, and measure one as well as the two-scale gap, greedy interface, and finite death certificates. It makes no novelty claim for those refinements; only the stated strict-tail antecedent has been compared here, and none settles #257. |
| The exact \(1/2\)-membership, fatal-gap, and last-producer package in this release | The strict-tail source above gives the global subsum geometry. The maintained search found no source stating the exact equivalence between \(1/2\)-membership, infinitely many greedy skips, cofinal false seam terminals, and absence of a last skip, nor the surviving middle-producer future-tail condition. | This is provisional theorem-specific positioning, not a novelty assertion. Positive membership would refute universal #257; nonmembership would decide only this test value. |
| J. Farey, [*On a Curious Property of Vulgar Fractions* (1816)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14786441608628487) | Historical source for the Farey/mediant language used by the finite denominator-exclusion frames. | The explicit Farey windows and denominator bound are Lean-checked arguments of this release, not historical results. |
| F. Luca and Y. Tachiya, [*Irrationality of Lambert series associated with a periodic sequence* (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1142/S1793042113501121) | Direct antecedent for the eventually-periodic coefficient family. Their rational-coefficient theorem contains the indicator-support case and the nonnegative rational weights formalised here. | Their theorem is broader, and its Chowla--Erdős/large-modulus-prime proof is separate. This release uses a periodic-divisor certificate route. For signed integer weights it proves only an irrational-or-base-terminating dichotomy; it does not exclude the terminating alternative in general or claim the full mixed-sign theorem. |
| T. Tao and J. Teräväinen, [*Quantitative correlations and some problems on prime factors of consecutive integers* (arXiv v2, 2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01739v2) | Direct source for the cited-only irrationality of the prime-support series, through its \(\sum_n\omega(n)/2^n\) formulation and this release's separately formalised identity bridge. | It settles that one support family, not universal #257; its quantitative correlation proof is not formalised here. |
| H. Wang and J. M. Grau Ribas, [*Positive dyadic density for rational weighted binary expansions* (arXiv, 2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.24972) | Direct antecedent for the rationality-forced integral carry recurrence in the weighted-binary special case (c(n)=n d_n). | The public generic criterion is a formalisation/abstraction; its converse and rigidity make no priority claim. The source's positive-density theorem and Erdős #260 corollary are neither used nor formalised here. |
| R. Crandall, [*The googol-th bit of the Erdős--Borwein constant* (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1515/integers-2012-0007); J. M. Campbell, [*On the binary digits of the Erdős--Borwein constant* (arXiv, 2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.24160) | Adjacent work on binary digits of the full-support constant; Campbell resolves Crandall's question on infinitely many occurrences of the block \(11\). | Neither result is formalised or used by this release, and neither changes its irrationality or open-problem claims. |

## Audit rule for new sources

Add a public citation only when the source can be tied to a named statement,
method, or historical formulation in the release. Before describing a source as
an antecedent of a local theorem family, record the exact statement comparison:
assumptions, conclusion, specialisation map, proof mechanism, and the remaining
delta. Otherwise, retain it as private research context rather than turning a
bibliographic lead into a public priority claim.
