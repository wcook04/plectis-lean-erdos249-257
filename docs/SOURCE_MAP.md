# Source map

## Bounded reader route

Start from one mathematical question rather than decoding the complete import
graph:

1. Read `docs/orientation.json`, or its human projection
   `docs/ORIENTATION.md`, and select one programme, claim, or exact remaining
   open proposition.
2. Run one bounded lookup:
   `python3 scripts/query_corpus.py --route <programme_id>`,
   `python3 scripts/query_corpus.py --claim <claim_id>`, or
   `python3 scripts/query_corpus.py --open <remaining_open.id>`.
3. Follow the returned paper label into the authored exposition and its
   declaration or source handles into the modules grouped below.
4. Read `Erdos249257.lean` or `ErdosProblems.lean` only when package topology
   itself is the question. Read `docs/WAVE_INDEX.md` for chronology, not as the
   recommended mathematical reading order.

Lean source checked by the pinned Lean kernel is proof authority. This map is
authored navigation: it does not strengthen a claim, replace
`docs/claims.json`, or close an exact remaining-open proposition. Erdős #249
and the universal form of #257 remain open.

## Build entrypoint

- `Erdos249257.lean`
- `ErdosProblems.lean`
- Lake package: `erdos249257`
- Lean libraries / stable root imports: `Erdos249257`, `ErdosProblems`

`Erdos249257` is the reviewed #249/#257 corpus. `ErdosProblems` is the
problem-owned expansion surface; unregistered declarations there remain exact
Lean propositions rather than reviewed public mathematical claims.

## #257 / Erdős–Borwein families

- `Erdos249257.CertificateKernel`
- Relevant declarations include: `irrational_erdosSum_full_support`,
  `irrational_erdosBorwein_series`, `irrational_erdosSum_factorial_support`,
  `irrational_erdosSum_two_pow_support`, and
  `irrational_erdosSupportSeries_eventuallyPeriodic`.

## Periodic weighted Lambert series

- `Erdos249257.CertificateKernel`
- Nonnegative weights:
  `irrational_weightedErdosSeries_periodic`,
  `irrational_weightedErdosSeries_eventuallyPeriodic`, and
  `irrational_ratWeightSeries_eventuallyPeriodic`.
- Signed weights:
  `irrational_or_bpow_mul_eq_intCast_intWeightedErdosSeries_periodic` gives
  the irrational-or-base-terminating dichotomy, while
  `irrational_intWeightedErdosSeries_periodic_of_bpow_mul_ne_intCast`
  consumes an explicit nontermination hypothesis.
- `intWeightedCoeff_periodFourSignWeight_eq_zero_of_mod_four_eq_three` is the
  residue-selection obstruction explaining why the signed endpoint is not
  unconditional irrationality.

## #249 / totient denominator exclusions

- `Erdos249257.GapFareyBound`
- `Erdos249257.CertificateKernel`

## #249 / certificate reductions

- `Erdos249257.TotientTailPeriodKiller`
- `Erdos249257.CarrySurvivorExtinction`
- `Erdos249257.LcmDiagonalReduction`
- `Erdos249257.LcmConeFlatness`
- `Erdos249257.LcmConeNonflat`

Supporting ladder modules:

- `Erdos249257.MersenneLambertLadder`
- `Erdos249257.GeometricCoprimality`
- `Erdos249257.GcdMomentCalculus`

## #249 / diagonal pincer frontier

Read this band after the certificate reductions above.  It sharpens the same
open obligation; it does not prove the required unbounded supply.

- `Erdos249257.DiagonalPincerDecomposition` — exact full-target interval
  characterisation and the target-avoidance-to-irrationality reduction.
- `Erdos249257.SquaredMersenneDiagonalEnclosure` — Lambert-projected centre,
  exact signed square tail, and a sharp separation criterion.
- `Erdos249257.DiagonalFreshLossBridge` — exact fresh-loss projection and
  stronger adjacent-suffix supply interfaces.
- `Erdos249257.DiagonalPincerCertificates` and
  `Erdos249257.DiagonalPincerCertificatesT*` — the finite diagonal segment,
  currently assembled at 28 explicit scales through `t = 64`.
- `Erdos249257.DiagonalPincerPrimeCertificates.*` — finite prime certificate
  shards used by that assembled segment; read the aggregators first.

Algebraic support for the same band:

- `MersenneShadowCyclotomicNoncollapse → MersenneShadowDenominatorGrowth`
- `RadicalMobiusShadow → RepunitMobiusNumerator → CyclicTensorMobiusShadow`
- `CyclotomicProjectionOfShadow → PrimePowerJumpDynamics`
- `RationalDenominatorSurvival`, `LambertDiagonalEnclosure`,
  and `FullTargetPrimeAdjunctionNoGo`

Exploratory exact interfaces with explicit conditional boundaries live in
`PrimitiveRationalGapSupply`, `PrimitiveSupportBridge`,
`ActualForeignResidueProjection`, `SternBrocotRunGeometry`, and
`SupportDilationDifferences`.

### Transport and curvature companion band

Read `CurvatureCarry → ExponentOnlyTransport → JointExponentTransport` for the
main proof spine, then `PrimeJumpMigration → PrimeJumpWindow` and
`ThreeTransportBoundary` for the new-prime and balanced finite consumers.
For the harmonic route, read
`FirstHarmonicGap → FirstHarmonicPivot → AdjacentPhaseSeparation`.
`FirstHarmonicGap` turns a constant-saving cosine bound into a direct
certificate. `FirstHarmonicPivot` decomposes the complex harmonic sum exactly
into centred supplier-fibre, fibre-mean, bad-supplier, and non-supplier terms;
the one-sided budgets `14X/25`, `X/100`, `X/100`, and `8X/25` give the required
`9X/10` saving. `AdjacentPhaseSeparation` gives a pairwise alternative. No
cofinal harmonic, prime-distribution, or decorrelation estimate is proved.
`TropicalCurvatureCarry` is a proved negative result showing that bounded
valuation–unit precision alone cannot exclude all centred completions.

- `CurvatureCarry` — exact curvature window, sharp radius, recurrence, and
  conditional unbounded-supply endpoints.
- `ExponentOnlyTransport` — squarefree support stability and the exact
  periodic affine slope/intercept state.
- `JointExponentTransport` — universal two-moment old-channel annihilation and
  the anchored `(3,5)` four-vertex consumer.
- `PrimeJumpMigration` / `PrimeJumpWindow` — migrated-channel correction,
  sharp direct radius, and the finite `(12,5,15)` certificate.
- `ThreeTransportBoundary` — balanced `(1,2,3,6)` consumer and the finite
  `(60,12)` certificate.
- `FirstHarmonicGap` — deterministic conversion of a blockwise harmonic gap
  into a direct certificate.
- `FirstHarmonicPivot` — exact four-term complex pivot decomposition and a
  conditional cofinal budget-to-irrationality socket.
- `TropicalCurvatureCarry` — fixed-precision local-signature no-go theorem.

The former one-sided transport companion is retired.  Its exact Lean results
remain available through the claim registry and source routes; no separate
active manuscript or rendered companion is part of this release.

### Paper-curation boundary

The paper treats `GcdMomentCalculus` as supporting mathematical exposition: its
squared Lambert transform, gcd moments, reduced-direction law, and cylinder
recursion explain the representation containing the #249 Möbius-square atom.
`FullTargetPrimeAdjunctionNoGo` is included as a proved negative result because
it closes a recurring prime-adjunction strategy without changing the open
claim. `SternBrocotRunGeometry` is registered as a source-level supporting
claim: its continuant/Fibonacci stability theorems are stated in the Lambert
complements, but no endpoint argument currently consumes them. It therefore
remains outside the paper's principal result spine; the cylinder law is owned
by `GcdMomentCalculus`, while `SternBrocotRunGeometry` owns the induced-run
stability package.

## Binary-carry trunk (post-wave carry layer)

Builds on `Erdos249257.CertificateKernel`; not part of the wave chronology.
Reading order:
`GenericTailOrbitRigidity → GreedyAchievementSet → CampbellShiftSynchronization → BooleanMobiusCarry → RationalSupportCarrySkeleton → DyadicPrefixCompression → SublogDivisorCoverage`.

- `Erdos249257.GenericTailOrbitRigidity`
- Relevant declarations include: `temperedBinaryOrbit_eq_scaledTail`, `binaryCoeffSeries_rational_iff_exists_temperedBinaryOrbit`, `balancedPulse_fanout_unbounded`, `balancedPulse_no_autonomous_decoder`

- `Erdos249257.GreedyAchievementSet`
- Relevant declarations include: `volume_mersenneAchievementSet`, `perfect_mersenneAchievementSet`, `isNowhereDense_mersenneAchievementSet`, `mem_mersenneAchievementSet_iff_greedy_survival`, `certifiedGreedyMersenneDeath_not_mem`, `three_fourths_not_mem_mersenneAchievementSet`, `rational_member_support_bit_iff`, `half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_of_prefixForcingChain` (conditional interface only)

- `Erdos249257.CampbellShiftSynchronization`
- Relevant declarations include:
  `campbellQuarterExponent_periodFreeze_noSync`,
  `campbellPhaseFreeze_parameters_impossible`,
  `shiftWindowZero_iff_greedyMersenneSkippedSupport_infinite`, and
  `shiftWindowZero_iff_half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet`. These are a
  synchronization no-go and an exact endpoint re-expression, not an
  independent half-membership producer.

- `Erdos249257.BooleanMobiusCarry`
- Relevant declarations include: `erdosSupportSeries_rational_iff_exists_temperedCarry`, `support_fraction_iff_exists_temperedCarry`, `exists_normalized_support_fraction_iff_exists_booleanMobiusCarry`, `mobius_carryQuotient_recovers_support`, `support_half_iff_affineBinaryOrbit_tempered`

- `Erdos249257.RationalSupportCarrySkeleton`
- Relevant declarations include: `sum_doublingResidue_eq_mul_wrapCount`, `one_div_oddOrder_le_reciprocalMass_of_support_fraction`, `reciprocalMass_eq_residueMean_add_excessMean`, `dyadic_support_fraction_reciprocalMass_diverges_or_gt_one`, `exists_unbounded_shifted_odd_tail_nat_state_of_support_fraction`

- `Erdos249257.DyadicPrefixCompression`
- This is #257 support, not part of the #249 diagonal band. It gives exact
  finite-fragment dyadic compression inside a hypothetical dyadic-rational
  support value, reduced/raw block-safety coordinates, primitive-lattice and
  support-tail-gap equivalences, conditional half-membership consumers, and
  checked failures of naive induction.
  Start with `finiteFragment_dyadicPrefixCompression`,
  `halfGreedyThreeDepthTakeRunExcessBound_iff_skippedExcessBound`,
  `greedyHalf_badSkipCapViolation_iff_primitiveLattice`,
  `halfGreedyPrefixSupportTailGap_eq_excess_div_denominator`, and
  `unsafeSkipGcdOvershootSupply_iff_primitive`. No cofinal witness supply is
  proved.

- `Erdos249257.SublogDivisorCoverage`
- Relevant declarations include: `supportCoeffZeroWindow_length_le_eps_logb_add`

## Half-value finite-prefix and boundary analysis

This band studies the test value `1/2` in ordinary finite-prefix language.
A greedy prefix is the first `n` include/skip decisions. A seam is a pair of
finite words whose values bracket `1/2`. A cylinder is the set of infinite
extensions of one fixed prefix. A producer is an unproved hypothesis that
supplies the required seams or return configurations arbitrarily far out.

Read the band in four layers:

1. `GreedyAchievementSet → HalfCutLocator` defines the achievement set, greedy
   coding, and the finite cut around `1/2`.
2. `HalfCarryReachability → HalfCylinderFiniteShadow` translates finite
   prefixes into integer carry and finite-shadow coordinates.
3. `HalfCylinderIntegerGreedy → HalfCylinderConcreteSeamAdapter →
   HalfCylinderFullShellSeamBridge → HalfCylinderSkippedEndpointClassifier →
   HalfCylinderFloorErrorReset → HalfCylinderSeamLimit` develops the exact
   boundary arithmetic and limiting seam interface.
4. `HalfCylinderFatalGapRightTail → HalfCylinderHalfMembershipClassification →
   HalfCylinderLastProducerContradiction → HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound`
   gives the endpoint classification, eliminates the upper and `-3` middle
   cases, and isolates the remaining carry-tail inequality for `-2` and `-1`.

The floor-error and shell modules are supporting arithmetic layers, not
separate endpoint theorems. The last layer remains conditional: no producer
supplying the required configurations cofinally is proved.

## Claim registry

- `docs/claims.json` — the single owner of release identity, claim statuses, and declaration coordinates (file and line), cross-checked by `scripts/check_release.py`

## Generated finite certificates

- `Erdos249257.GeneratedCertificates`
- `Erdos249257.GeneratedCertificates.*`

The complete import graph and every declaration are generated in
`docs/claims.json::machine_readable_paper.module_graph` and
`docs/declaration_atlas.json`; use those surfaces when a grouped route above is
not specific enough. Current corpus counts live in the generated
`docs/ORIENTATION.md`, not in this authored route map.
